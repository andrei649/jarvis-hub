# Jarvis Hub — Status Snapshot

> **Current version:** v9.9.9 (pre-1.0 audit gate) · **Tests:** 2,156 passed (1 skipped) + 184 frontend JS · **Agents:** 17 active (16 cabinet incl. Howard + Argus, the WorldView bridge; + 17 bench) · **HTTP routes:** ~253
> **Road to v1.0:** the v1.0 backlog (H1–H17) is **code-complete — 194/196 items (≈99% SP)**, shipped pending the `9.9.9` audit gate (full code audit [docs/AUDIT.md](docs/AUDIT.md), human manual testing [docs/MANUAL_TESTING.md](docs/MANUAL_TESTING.md), and fixes). The only two open items (H12.14, H13.3) need the GPU host. HUD V2 is the default UI; deep write-controls for newer backend surfaces are tracked in [docs/design/HUD_V2_REMAINING.md](docs/design/HUD_V2_REMAINING.md). See [BACKLOG.md](BACKLOG.md#version-roadmap) + [MOONSHOT.md](MOONSHOT.md) §4.
>
> The version labels in the feature tables below (`v0.2.0`, `v0.2.1`) record *when* each capability first
> landed (provenance), not the current release. For live priorities and the v1.0 gate, BACKLOG.md is the source of truth.

## 🟡 Known Gaps

| Gap | vs | Impact |
|-----|----|--------|
| ✅ Security Guardrails (v0.2.1) | OpenJarvis | Pure-Python PII/secret scanner, SSRF, audit |
| ✅ Sandbox (v0.2.1) | OpenJarvis (Docker + WASM) | Docker + subprocess execution |
| ✅ Skills Import (v0.2.1) | OpenJarvis (agentskills.io) | Hermes/OpenClaw/GitHub import |
| ✅ Multi-Channel (v0.2.1) | OpenJarvis (18+) | Now 6 channels (web, voice, telegram, discord, email, slack) |
| ✅ Bench System (v0.2.1) | OpenJarvis | Latency/throughput/success tracking |
| ❌ Desktop App | OpenJarvis (Tauri) | No native desktop UI |
| ❌ Rust Extension | OpenJarvis (14 crates) | No Rust — pure Python only |
| ❌ SFT/GRPO Training | OpenJarvis | No model fine-tuning (needs GPU) |
| ❌ WASM Sandbox | OpenJarvis (wasmtime) | Docker-only sandbox |

> **Real-category parity (2026-06-02 — vs personal/proactive/private AI competitors, not just the OpenJarvis ancestor; full analysis: `docs/research/2026-06-02-personal-ai-competitors.md`):**

| Gap | vs | Impact |
|-----|----|--------|
| ⚠️ Direct rival — governance wedge | **OpenClaw** | Same thesis (self-hosted, proactive, local-capable); we are the *governed/secure* alternative (H12.1) |
| ❌ Multi-surface passive capture | **Pieces.app** | Only text conversations ingested; no opt-in browser/clipboard/files → KG (H12.7) |
| ❌ Frictionless folder → doc-chat onboarding | **GPT4All / Khoj** | Config-heavy first run (H12.2) |
| ❌ Polished local-model management UX | **Jan.ai** | No one-click model browse/download/switch (H12.9) |
| ❌ Local voice hardware + Wyoming interop | **Home Assistant** | No satellite-mic / Wyoming support (H12.4, H12.8) |

## Decisions — resolved 2026-05-11

1. Wake words: **both** `jarvis` + `hub` ✅
2. Addressing: **"sir"** ✅
3. Frigga WhatsApp: **local bridge + manual entry fallback** ✅
4. Cloud LLM: **local by default, on-demand cloud for approved agents** ✅
   - Approved for cloud fallback: Jarvis, Athena, Stark, Vision, Veronica
